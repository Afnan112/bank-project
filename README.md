=======
#### I have only one class representing clients, while the rest of the components consist of independent functions that perform specific functions.

#### The reason I used a single class was that I didn’t understand exactly what was meant. My mistake was that I didn’t ask, believing that one class was enough. I rushed through the code. I recently learned from my colleagues that I need at least four classes. I asked Mr. Connor, and he explained it to me last night. However, I couldn’t make any changes because the code took too long, so I left it as is. However, after completing my code, I realized that I need classes to organize the code and make it easier.

#### I hope I did a good job on this project, and that using a single class doesn’t affect my project evaluation.
